\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have described the solving technique of non-linear real arithmetic with virtual substitution step by step. The solving technique has two steps. One is to construct test candidates with side conditions and another one is to replace all occurrences of a variable in a non-linear real arithmetic formula by a test candidate. This replacement is based on virtual substitution rules. Finally, we find solution values for which the formula is satisfied.
