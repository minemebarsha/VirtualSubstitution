\begin{abstract}
We present the virtual substitution method as published in \cite{weispfenning} which is an incomplete quantifier elimination procedure for non-linear real arithmetic formulas.The solution approach relies on some substitution rules of virtual substitution. The rules can be applied only on real-arithmetic formulas which has a degree not higher than $2$. If the degree is more than $2$, the quantifier elimination procedure becomes complex.
